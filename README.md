# MedallionFlow: Scalable Data Lakehouse for AdventureWorks 🚀

## 📌 Project Overview

**MedallionFlow** is a modern data engineering project built on the AdventureWorks dataset using the **Medallion Architecture**. This solution leverages **Azure Data Factory**, **Databricks (PySpark)**, and **Azure Synapse Analytics** to enable a scalable, reliable, and production-grade data pipeline. The project demonstrates best practices in data lakehouse design, batch processing, and real-time reporting using Microsoft Azure services.

## 🏗️ Architecture

This project follows the **Medallion Architecture** model:
- **Bronze Layer**: Raw data ingestion from CSV files into Azure Data Lake using Azure Data Factory.
- **Silver Layer**: Cleaned and transformed data using PySpark notebooks on Azure Databricks.
- **Gold Layer**: Business-ready data curated for analytics and consumed by Power BI or Synapse Analytics for reporting.
